## Responsible innovation and trustworthy AI

This GitHub repository provides an introduction to responsible innovation and  
trustworthy AI using SAS Viya Workbench for Learners for practices.  

After starting SAS Viya Workbench, open a terminal* and run the following command to  
clone the repository content into the root of your workspace:

    git -C $WORKSPACE clone https://github.com/porjdv/WFL_Trustworthy_AI_Life_Cycle.git

\* To open a terminal, you can use the key combination "Control" + "Shift" + "C" or  
enter the menu at the top left and navigate to `Terminal` followed by `New Terminal`.  

You can then proceed with the following steps to start a workshop or (self-)study:

1. Start the session by showing how to start visual studio code in SAS Viya Workbench for Learners
2. Demonstrate how to open a terminal (if it is not open)
3. Demonstrate how to import the github repository with the files used in the session
4. Open 01_visual_studio_code_notebook_and_python_introduction.ipynb for review and (self-)study
